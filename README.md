# Photo-sorter
Python script to organize photos into folders by date
It takes photos (and videos) from an original folder and it's sub-folders, organizes them into a nested folder structure by date (YY/MM/DD) and renames the photo to the time

Hopefuly this explains the code.
PS: This is my first project and work put on github, so im just happy it works
